## 🚀 What We Do

**OpenBookings** is an open-source booking platform for hotels and vacation properties — built to **eliminate platform commissions** and keep prices fair for both travelers and hosts.

We believe booking a place to stay shouldn’t come with hidden fees, inflated prices, or closed ecosystems.

Our mission is simple:  
> **Direct bookings. Transparent pricing. Zero middlemen.**
